# To-do

* Rewrite the "going in circles" animation using vectors from GLM
* Trace a path behind the circle
* Replace the circle with  actual physics

# Week of 4/13/2019 (Exploratory Work):

I created a simple animation of a point going in circles using the 2D graphics library.

I also found Python code simulates planetary orbits with the turtle module. This is mainly a proof of concept that
the back-end of the simulation should be feasible. I'll probably use the same mathematical techniques for my simulation.
