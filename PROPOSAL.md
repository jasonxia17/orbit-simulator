# Tools for learning physics

My goal is to make tool(s) that help students with learning physics. I've already made one such tool in the past
using Javascript. It demonstrates the Lorentz Transformation, which basically dictates how events appear in a relativistic
frame of reference.

I would like to extend this collection by developing more tools using Open Frameworks. The first tool I'll try to
create is a simulation of planetary motion. This is inherently hard to set up in a laboratory setting, but I think
it's still a valuable experience for students to have hands-on experience experimenting with the behavior of planets.

I know that a lot of planet simulations already exist out on the web, but I want to try to provide something
more unique in my application: an easy way to change parameters (initial positions and velocity) and an easy way
to measure data at any time (e.g. distances and velocity). I believe this provides pedagogical value, because
it allows users to use this tool as if it were a real laboratory experiment.

Hopefully, experimenting with planets in this app will solidify students' understandings of Kepler's Laws and
the transitions between circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyporbolic orbits (which is related to the energy
of the planet).

If I have time, I'll considering including additional tools in my final project.
